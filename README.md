# PSSmartsheet

## Description ##
Powershell Module for interacting with the Smartsheet API.

I wrote this module part as a learning excersize, but also to be used by the scripts I've written for work. It is by no means feature complete. I'm hoping that other may find it usefull, and even be able to contribute to make it better.

## Installation ##

This module is available for download on the Powershell Gallery at https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSSmartsheet/.
You can install in with the following Powershell command:

`Install-Module -Name PSSmartsheet`

You can also simply clone this repo and import the PSD1 file manually.
